# Task - Make

Write a program that outputs a joke.  The joke and the punchline should output on separate lines.

There will sometimes be extension tasks on Make projects. These are not required, but will teach you how to research and read about Python capabilities. They will also teach you some features that we may not get to/or will get to later. If you finish early, try one or both.


## Extension Task 1

There is a way to use a single print statement to output text on multiple lines.  [Do some research](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-new-line-and-how-to-python-print-without-a-newline/) and create the joke program that works in the same way but only uses **one** print statement.

## Extension Task 2

There is a way to add a time delay into python code. [Do some research](https://realpython.com/python-sleep/) and create a joke program that outputs the joke, and delays before it outputs the punchline.
